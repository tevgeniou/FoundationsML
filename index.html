    <h3><strong>Course Description</strong></h3>

<p style="text-align: justify;">AI and Machine Learning have become central topics of discussion in the popular press after being developed for over 50 years in Academia - by computer scientists and, in more recent years, by mathematicians and statisticians. These fields are expected to have a major impact in potentially every aspect of research as well as business: from basic science fields such as life sciences, to Decision Sciences, Finance, but also areas like Sociology, Economics, and other Social Sciences. 
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">However, while one can be a "reasonable" user of some popular machine learning and AI methods, gaining an edge in terms of innovation in research and practice but also taking full advantage of the capabilities offered by these technologies requires a more fundamental understanding of the principles behind these booming fields. 
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The goal of this course is to: </p>
<ul>

<li>Provide the foundations of Machine Learning and AI, so that students can better understand these methods, use them, and potentially develop their own custom based ones that can also use to advance their respective fields;
<li>Provide an overview of some of the most important machine learning methods used in research and practice;
<li>Provide students not only with a historical perspective of these fields, but also with a view of the state-of-the-art methodologies and research advances as well as views on future directions;
<li>Help students use machine learning methods appropriately in their research fields, with the aim of developing insights that are only feasible due to the usage of these new "microscopes". 

</ul>
  
<p style="text-align: justify;"> The course will be run as a combination of lectures, discussions of important papers, exercises, coding (in R or Python), and a class project.  Participants are required to have knowledge of the core Probability and Statistics (I and II) courses.

  <p style="text-align: justify;"><h3>Grading</h3>
  <p style="text-align: justify;">20% Class Participation and Paper Presentation  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify;"> 30% Exercises: two exercise sets, combining mathematical and hands-on application exercises
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify;"> 50% Class Project: "Develop Your Own Machine Learning Method and Share the Code on Github". </p>
  <p style="text-align: justify;"></p>
  
<strong>Class Project:</strong> You will need to work either alone or at most with one more colleague on the following project: 

<ul>
<li> Define a research question that involves - or can be framed as - a problem which can be approached using machine learning methods and principles. For example, it can be part of a research project you may be interested in for which you need to solve a prediction, estimation, or data representation problem. 
<li> Describe what are some specific (idiosyncratic) characteristics of the problem, for example regarding some data generation process or structure of the problem and data. 
<li> Develop a machine learning method that captures the "structure" of the problem that you identified. Setup an optimization problem and explain how that fits with machine learning theory principles. 
<li> Formulate at least two alternative optimization formulations (hence also possibly two different machine learning "methods") for your proposed approach. Discuss how one could approach the optimization. 
<li> Write pseudocode for your method 
<li> (Extra credit - but recommended) Code your method (using Jupiter notebooks with R, Python or any other language you are most familiar with) and share it on a github repository (see www.github.com). Use your method either on data you have and/or on simulated data. For simulated data, explore how the method works as the data generation process "fits" more (or less) the structure your method assumes. Also explore the trade off between (over)fitting and complexity control, devising also a (out of sample) test process.
<li> Prepare a report (can be on the same Jupiter notebook/document as your code) and be ready to discuss your work in Sessions 13-14.
